# App Manager

App Manager helps you manage your apps.  It currently is very basic.

Does now:

1. Install apps from github.
2. View list of installed apps
3. Delete apps

Will do:

1. Allow you to add local apps
2. view available apps
3. update apps

### Contributing

We are working on making it simpler to develope apps for Silk GUI.  We are not there yet.

``` bash
cd path/to/silk/apps
git clone https://github.com/Silk-GUI/appManager
```

To make it easier to reload when you change the server, `cd path/to/Silk` and run `nodemon server.js`.  To reload the client, there is a reload button.
